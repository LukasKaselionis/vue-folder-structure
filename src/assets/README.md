Images: You can place image files (e.g., .png, .jpg, .svg) in the "assets" folder and then reference them in your Vue components or templates using relative paths.

Stylesheets: You can include CSS files in the "assets" folder, and you can import them into your Vue components or the main application stylesheet if needed.

Fonts: If your project uses custom fonts, you can store font files (e.g., .woff, .woff2) in the "assets" folder and reference them in your CSS or SCSS files.

Static Data: If you have JSON files or other static data that your application needs, you can place them in the "assets" folder and fetch or import them as needed.
